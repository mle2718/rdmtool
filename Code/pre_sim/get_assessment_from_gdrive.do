 Script:       get_assessment_from_gdrive.do
 Purpose:      Copies the stock assessment numbers-at-age files from the shared
               NMFS Google Drive into the local $misc_data_cd folder, so that
               downstream projection scripts read from a local path instead of
               a network mount. The assessment output (historical
               numbers-at-age plus projections) is produced outside this repo
               and delivered via Drive.
 Inputs:       Every file in the shared Drive folder
               .../flukeRDM/input_data (as currently written the script copies
               the whole folder; see the note on the disabled block below).
               Expected members, as named by the consumer
               projected_catch_at_length.do: fit_NAA_NORTH_2024.csv,
               fit_NAA_SOUTH_2024.csv, fit_proj_NAA_NORTH_2026.csv,
               fit_proj_NAA_SOUTH_2026.csv, J1_2024Summer_Flounder.csv,
               J1_2024Scup.csv, J1_2026Summer_Flounder.csv,
               J1_2026Scup.csv. The years are literal and change each cycle.
 Outputs:      A verbatim copy into $misc_data_cd of each file above:
               fit_NAA_NORTH_2024.csv, fit_NAA_SOUTH_2024.csv,
               fit_proj_NAA_NORTH_2026.csv, fit_proj_NAA_SOUTH_2026.csv,
               J1_2024Summer_Flounder.csv, J1_2024Scup.csv,
               J1_2026Summer_Flounder.csv, J1_2026Scup.csv.
 Dependencies: Global $misc_data_cd (set in model_wrapper.do). Requires the
               Google Drive desktop client to be installed and the shared
               drive mounted at D: - the path below is a local filesystem
               path, not an API call, so no OAuth token is needed here.
 Pipeline:     Step 1 of model_wrapper.do, gated by the `pull_assessment'
               toggle (default ON). Feeds projected_catch_at_length.do, which
               is the consumer of the numbers-at-age data.

   this was the selective-copy approach - name the wanted files, resolve each
   stub to the most recent matching file on Drive, and copy only those. It is
   disabled, and both `filestubs' lines are therefore dead (the second would
   overwrite the first in any case). The active code is the copy-everything
   loop at the bottom of the file. Keep this in mind when reading: the file
