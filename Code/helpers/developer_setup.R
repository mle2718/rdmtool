# Script:       developer_setup.R
# Purpose:      Resolves the per-developer root directory for the 2028
#               management-cycle data and exposes it as the object
#               sf.data.dir. Every other R script in the repo builds its
#               data paths from sf.data.dir rather than hardcoding a root,
#               so this is the single place a new machine gets configured.
#               Rationale: processed data is far too large to commit, so the
#               developer who runs the processing steps (LCH) keeps it on an
#               external drive while everyone else keeps it under Data/ in
#               the repo, where .gitignore excludes it.
# Inputs:       None.
# Outputs:      None (creates the data directory on disk if absent; defines
#               the object sf.data.dir in the calling environment).
# Dependencies: The object `developer` must already be set to one of "TP",
#               "LCH", "ML", or "KB" before this file is sourced. Sourced
#               independently by each R script that needs a data path; it is
#               NOT sourced by "R code wrapper.R".
# Pipeline:     Setup stage. Stata twin of this file is
#               developer_setup_stata.do, which sets the global $sfdatadir
#               to the same locations. The four allowed developer values and
#               this two-branch structure are shared infrastructure with
#               GroundfishRDM, which uses $gfdatadir for the same role.
# Dev paths:    1 hardcoded absolute path to a developer's local machine
#               (E:\), at line 34 - this is the file's entire purpose (the
#               LCH branch of the per-developer split), not an oversight.

# The assertion is deliberate: an unrecognized developer name would otherwise
# fall through both branches below and leave sf.data.dir undefined, producing a
# confusing "object not found" error much later in whatever script sourced this.
