# Script:       calibration_routine_final.R
# Purpose:      Calibration PASS 1 - the search that closes the model-vs-MRIP
#               harvest gap measured by PASS 0. For each state x mode x draw
#               and each species it searches for the reallocation proportion p
#               that brings simulated harvest within tolerance of MRIP, by
#               repeatedly re-running the trip simulation with a candidate p
#               and narrowing a bracket around it. The reallocation itself is
#               performed by calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R, which this script
#               sources inside the loop; this file owns the search logic, the
#               convergence criteria and the bookkeeping.
#
#               What p means: anglers do not perfectly obey size and bag
#               limits, and they voluntarily release legal fish. PASS 0
#               simulates strict compliance and therefore misses MRIP. p is
#               the fraction of modeled releases converted to harvest
#               ("rel_to_keep", when the model under-harvests) or of modeled
#               harvest converted to releases ("keep_to_rel", when it
#               over-harvests). It is a calibration parameter, not an
#               estimated behavioral quantity.
# Inputs:       simulated_catch_totals.dta, calibration_comparison.fst
#               (PASS 0's output), and the per-draw calibration catch files
#               read by the sourced simulation script.
# Outputs:      calibrated_model_stats.fst,
#               n_choice_occasions_<ST>_<MODE>_<DRAW>.fst,
#               base_outcomes_<ST>_<MODE>_<DRAW>.fst
# Dependencies: Objects iterative_input_data_cd and input_data_cd must exist
#               in the calling environment - set by "R code wrapper.R", which
#               sources this file as STEP 2. Sources
#               calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R repeatedly.
# Pipeline:     Second of the three R steps. Consumes PASS 0's comparison
#               table; its output feeds the projection stage and is also what
#               "check calibration convergence.do" filters down to 100 usable
#               draws.
# Dev paths:    1 hardcoded absolute path to a developer's local machine
#               (E:\), at line 77.
#
# HOW THE SEARCH WORKS (the part worth understanding before editing):
#   - Convergence for a species is is_achieved(): harvest within 500 fish OR
#     within 5% of MRIP. Same criterion as "check calibration convergence.do".
#   - When not converged, score_species() ranks candidate p values so the best
#     attempt so far can be kept even if nothing fully converges. The score is
#     keep_score + 0.15 * catch_score, so matching HARVEST dominates and total
#     catch acts only as a tie-breaker. The catch tolerances are also
#     deliberately looser (5x on absolute, 4x on percent).
#   - update_bracket() maintains a [lo, hi] bracket on p in [0, 1] and
#     bisects. max_iter = 25 caps the search; p_tol = 1e-4 decides when p is
#     effectively 0 or 1.
#   - Strata where MRIP harvest is exactly zero are special-cased throughout:
#     a percent difference is undefined there, so only the absolute criterion
#     applies and only keep_to_rel is meaningful.
#   - push_globals() writes the current p and direction into the GLOBAL
#     environment. That is how the sourced simulation script receives them -
#     it reads variables like p_rel_to_keep_sf by name rather than taking
#     arguments. This is the coupling to be careful of when refactoring.
#
# NOTE - THE STATE AND DRAW LISTS ARE RESTRICTED. Below, the full nine-state
# vector is immediately overwritten by c("MA", "RI"), and draws is set to 1:3.
# As committed this calibrates two states and three draws, not the production
# set. This reads as debug configuration left in place; it is deliberately NOT
# changed here.

#'   released fish within X inches below the minimum size, starting at X = 3.
#'   A stratum can run out of eligible fish before it closes the harvest gap -
#'   it needs more converted fish than exist in that window. This detects that
#'   case: still short on harvest, still not converged, and reallocating
#'   upward. The caller responds by widening the window to 4 inches and
#'   re-running.
#' @param rel_to_keep Whether this stratum is converting releases to harvest.
#' @param convergence The stratum's current convergence flag.
#' @param diff_keep,pct_diff_keep Remaining harvest difference, fish and percent.
#' @param MRIP_keep MRIP harvest, for the zero-target case.
#' @return TRUE if the stratum should be re-run with the wider window.
