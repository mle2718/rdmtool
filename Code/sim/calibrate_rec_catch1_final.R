# Script:       calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R
# Purpose:      Calibration PASS 1 simulation - the same calibration-year trip
#               simulation as PASS 0, but with a reallocation step applied.
#               Where PASS 0 assumes perfect regulatory compliance, this
#               version converts a proportion p of modeled releases into
#               harvest (sublegal fish kept) or a proportion of modeled
#               harvest into releases (legal fish voluntarily released),
#               depending on which direction the model missed MRIP.
#               calibration_routine_final.R sources this file repeatedly,
#               varying p, until simulated harvest lands within tolerance.
# Inputs:       calib_catch_draws_<ST>_<i>.fst, baseline_catch_at_length.csv,
#               L_W_Conversion.csv (read from a hardcoded absolute path), and
#               the MRIP totals, read via the calling environment.
# Outputs:      None written directly. Returns results to the search routine,
#               which persists calibrated_model_stats, base_outcomes and
#               n_choice_occasions files.
# Dependencies: SOURCED, NOT CALLED. calibration_routine_final.R sources this
#               file inside its search loop and passes the current
#               reallocation settings through GLOBAL VARIABLES
#               (rel_to_keep_<sp>, p_rel_to_keep_<sp> and siblings, written by
#               that script's push_globals()). There is no argument-passing
#               contract between the two files.
# Pipeline:     Inner loop of R calibration STEP 2. Sibling of
#               calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R, from which it inherits
#               safe_divide(), calc_prob_trip() and build_compare_table()
#               VERBATIM - those three functions are duplicated across the two
#               files rather than shared. See those definitions in
#               calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R for their documentation;
#               only what is new here is documented below.
# Dev paths:    1 hardcoded absolute path to a developer's local machine
#               (C:\), at line 499 (the L_W_Conversion.csv read).
#
# THE UTILITY ADJUSTMENT - the subtlest thing in this file.
# Reallocation creates a conflict between two uses of the same fish. A fish
# moved from kept to released must count as RELEASED in the harvest and
# discard totals that get compared to MRIP - that is the whole point. But the
# angler in the simulation decided to take the trip believing they would keep
# it, so for the purposes of trip UTILITY it must still count as kept;
# otherwise reallocating fish would silently change anglers' trip-taking
# decisions and the calibration would be adjusting two things at once.
# The file therefore carries two parallel sets of columns:
#   tot_keep_<sp>_new  / tot_rel_<sp>_new   accounting - what MRIP is compared to
#   tot_keep_<sp>_util / tot_rel_<sp>_util  behavioral - what enters utility
# This applies to summer flounder and black sea bass only. Scup enters the
# utility function as TOTAL CATCH (sqrt_scup_catch), so moving a scup between
# kept and released does not change utility and no adjustment is needed.
#
# THE SUBLEGAL WINDOW. Converting releases to harvest is not unrestricted: the
# eligible fish are released fish within `floor_sublegal` inches BELOW the
# minimum size, on the reasoning that an angler who keeps an illegal fish
# keeps a near-legal one, not a tiny one. The window starts at 3 inches and
# the search routine widens it to 4 when a stratum runs out of eligible fish
# (see needs_floor4_rerun() in calibration_routine_final.R).

# calibration-year trip simulation WITH optional trip-level harvest/release reallocation
# optimized for speed/efficiency while retaining fish-level expansion

#' @title Apply bag and size limits, then reallocate harvest or releases
#' @description The PASS 1 counterpart of simulate_species() in
#'   calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R. Expands each trip's catch to individual
#'   fish, draws lengths, applies the minimum size and the bag limit in
#'   encounter order - and then moves a proportion of the outcome across the
#'   kept/released line to close the gap against MRIP.
#'
#'   Two directions, mutually exclusive:
#'     rel_to_keep - the model under-harvested. A proportion p_rel_to_keep of
#'       RELEASED fish lying within `floor_sublegal` inches below the minimum
#'       size is reclassified as kept. Restricting to near-legal fish is a
#'       behavioral assumption: an angler who keeps an undersized fish keeps
#'       one just short of legal, not an obviously tiny one. A stratum can
#'       exhaust this pool, which is what triggers the wider-window re-run.
#'     keep_to_rel - the model over-harvested. A proportion p_keep_to_rel of
#'       KEPT fish is reclassified as released, representing voluntary
#'       release of legal fish. all_keep_to_rel short-circuits the degenerate
#'       case where every kept fish is converted.
#'
#'   When utility_adjust is TRUE the function maintains the separate _util
#'   columns described in the file header, so that reallocation changes the
#'   harvest accounting without disturbing anglers' simulated trip decisions.
#' @param catch_dt Trip-level data.table keyed on date, mode, tripid and
#'   catch_draw, carrying catch counts and the regulations in force.
#' @param catch_col,bag_col,min_col Column names holding this species' catch
#'   count, bag limit and minimum size.
#' @param size_dt Catch-at-length lookup with `length` and `fitted_prob`.
#' @param species_prefix One of "sf", "bsb", "scup"; determines output column
#'   names.
#' @param floor_sublegal How many inches below the minimum size a released
#'   fish may be and still be eligible for conversion to harvest. 3 normally,
#'   widened to 4 when a stratum runs short.
#' @param rel_to_keep,keep_to_rel Direction flags; at most one is 1.
#' @param p_rel_to_keep,p_keep_to_rel The proportion to convert, in [0, 1].
#'   Supplied by the search routine through the global environment.
#' @param all_keep_to_rel Flag for the boundary case p = 1 on keep_to_rel.
#' @param utility_adjust Whether to maintain the separate utility columns.
#'   TRUE for summer flounder and black sea bass, FALSE for scup, which enters
#'   utility only as total catch.
#' @return A list with `trip` (the per-trip kept/released/weight columns, plus
#'   the utility columns when requested) and four diagnostics the search uses:
#'   n_sub_kept, n_legal_rel, prop_sub_kept and prop_legal_rel - the counts and
#'   proportions actually converted, which can fall short of what was
#'   requested when the eligible pool runs out.
