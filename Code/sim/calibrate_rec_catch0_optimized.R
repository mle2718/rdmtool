# Script:       calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R
# Purpose:      Calibration PASS 0 - simulate the calibration year exactly as
#               the regulations were written, with NO adjustment for illegal
#               harvest or voluntary release, and measure how far the result
#               lands from MRIP. For each state x mode x draw it expands each
#               simulated trip's catch to individual fish, draws each fish a
#               length from the baseline catch-at-length distribution, applies
#               the minimum size and bag limit to classify it kept or
#               released, computes trip utility and the probability the trip
#               is taken, expands to population totals, and tabulates
#               model-vs-MRIP differences by species and disposition.
#               The gaps it measures are the input to PASS 1
#               (calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R), which reallocates harvest and
#               discards until those gaps close.
# Inputs:       simulated_catch_totals.dta, baseline_catch_at_length.csv,
#               calib_catch_draws_<ST>_<i>.fst
# Outputs:      calibration_comparison.fst
# Dependencies: The objects input_data_cd, iterative_input_data_cd and
#               n_simulations must already exist in the calling environment -
#               they are set by "R code wrapper.R", which sources this file as
#               STEP 1.
# Pipeline:     First of the three R calibration/projection steps. Its sibling
#               calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R reuses the same modeling logic
#               with reallocation added.
# Dev paths:    1 hardcoded absolute path to a developer's local machine
#               (E:\), at line 308.
#
# Why "optimized": an earlier version (Code/archive/calibrate_rec_catch0.R)
# performed the same computation but re-read the catch-at-length file inside
# the innermost loop. This version preloads it once and leans on data.table
# grouped operations. The fish-level expansion was deliberately RETAINED -
# bag limits bind on individual fish in size order, so they cannot be applied
# to trip-level totals without changing the answer.
#
# NOTE - preference coefficients are hardcoded here, not read from Stata.
# The beta_* values in the simulation loop are literal numbers (e.g.
# beta_sqrt_sf_keep mean 0.827, sd 1.267) rather than reads from
# preference_params.dta, the file estimate_angler_preferences.do exists to
# produce. Two consequences worth understanding: (1) the same coefficient
# means are used on every draw, so sampling uncertainty in the estimated
# preferences is NOT propagated through the calibration, only heterogeneity
# across simulated anglers is; (2) if the choice model is ever re-estimated,
# these literals must be updated by hand or the calibration will silently
# keep using the old preferences. The sd = 0 entries correspond exactly to
# the parameters estimate_angler_preferences.do zeroes out as insignificant.

#' @title Divide, returning NA instead of Inf on a zero denominator
#' @description Used for the reallocation proportions at the end of
#'   build_compare_table(). A stratum can legitimately have zero modeled
#'   releases or zero modeled harvest, and the resulting Inf would propagate
#'   into the reallocation step as a nonsensical instruction. NA marks the
#'   stratum as "no reallocation possible" instead.
#' @param num Numerator.
#' @param den Denominator; zero or NA yields NA.
#' @return Numeric vector of quotients, NA wherever the denominator was zero
#'   or missing.
safe_divide <- function(num, den) {
  ifelse(is.na(den) | den == 0, NA_real_, num / den)
}

#' @title Probability of choosing the trip over opting out
#' @description Binary logit probability, computed in a numerically stable
#'   way. The naive form 1/(1+exp(-z)) overflows to Inf for large negative z,
#'   which matters here because opt-out utilities can be far from trip
#'   utilities for unattractive regulation scenarios. The function therefore
#'   branches: for z >= 0 it uses 1/(1+exp(-z)), and for z < 0 it uses
#'   exp(z)/(1+exp(z)). Both are algebraically identical to the logit but each
#'   only ever exponentiates a non-positive number, so neither can overflow.
#' @param v_trip Deterministic utility of taking the trip.
#' @param v_optout Deterministic utility of the opt-out (no-trip) alternative.
#' @return Numeric vector of probabilities in [0, 1] that the trip is taken.
# stable binary logit probability for the trip alternative
calc_prob_trip <- function(v_trip, v_optout) {
  z <- v_trip - v_optout
  out <- numeric(length(z))
  pos <- z >= 0
  out[pos] <- 1 / (1 + exp(-z[pos]))
  ez <- exp(z[!pos])
  out[!pos] <- ez / (1 + ez)
  out
}

#' @title Apply bag and size limits to one species, fish by fish
#' @description Turns a trip-level catch count into kept and released counts
#'   by simulating individual fish. Each trip's catch is expanded to one row
#'   per fish, each fish is assigned a length drawn from the baseline
#'   catch-at-length distribution, and fish at or above the minimum size are
#'   marked legally keepable. The bag limit is then applied in encounter
#'   order via a running count of keepable fish: the first `bag` keepable fish
#'   are kept and everything after is released.
#'
#'   Fish-level expansion is the reason this function exists rather than a
#'   trip-level formula. Whether a given fish is kept depends on how many
#'   keepable fish preceded it on that trip, which cannot be recovered from
#'   trip totals. Trips with zero catch skip the expansion entirely and are
#'   rejoined at the end, which keeps the expanded table as small as possible.
#' @param catch_dt Trip-level data.table with one row per
#'   date x mode x tripid x catch_draw, carrying catch counts and the
#'   regulations in force.
#' @param catch_col Name of the column holding this species' catch count.
#' @param bag_col Name of the column holding the bag limit in force.
#' @param min_col Name of the column holding the minimum size in force.
#' @param size_dt Catch-at-length lookup with columns `length` and
#'   `fitted_prob`, giving the sampling distribution of fish lengths.
#' @param species_prefix One of "sf", "bsb" or "scup"; determines the names of
#'   the two output columns (tot_keep_<prefix>_new, tot_rel_<prefix>_new).
#' @return A data.table keyed on date, mode, tripid and catch_draw with kept
#'   and released counts for this species, covering both the zero-catch and
#'   positive-catch trips.

#' @title Tabulate model-vs-MRIP differences and the implied reallocation
#' @description Reshapes the simulated totals and the MRIP estimates to a
#'   common long form, joins them on mode x species x disposition, and
#'   computes absolute and percent differences. It then derives what PASS 1
#'   needs in order to close the gap: a direction flag and a proportion.
#'
#'   The direction logic reads as follows. If the model harvests LESS than
#'   MRIP (diff_keep < 0), some fish the model released must in reality have
#'   been kept, so rel_to_keep is flagged and p_rel_to_keep gives the share of
#'   modeled releases that would have to be converted. If the model harvests
#'   MORE than MRIP (diff_keep > 0), the reverse: keep_to_rel is flagged and
#'   p_keep_to_rel gives the share of modeled harvest to convert. These
#'   proportions are the "illegal harvest / voluntary release" adjustments
#'   that PASS 0 deliberately omits.
#' @param summed_results Population-expanded simulated totals for one draw,
#'   with one row per mode and columns like sf_keep, sf_rel, sf_catch.
#' @param MRIP_comparison_draw The MRIP survey totals for the same stratum,
#'   with matching column names.
#' @param md The mode label to stamp on the result.
#' @return A data.table with one row per mode x species carrying the MRIP
#'   value, model value, difference and percent difference for each of keep,
#'   release and catch, plus the reallocation direction flags and proportions.
