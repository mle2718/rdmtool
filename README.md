# flukeRDM (`rdmtool`)

Recreational Fisheries Decision Support Tool for summer flounder, black sea bass and scup.

## Overview

flukeRDM implements a Stata → R → Shiny pipeline that simulates how recreational fishing
regulations — season dates, bag limits and minimum sizes — affect fishing outcomes for
summer flounder, black sea bass and scup across nine Mid-Atlantic states (MA, RI, CT, NY,
NJ, DE, MD, VA, NC). Raw MRIP survey data and stock assessment output are processed in
Stata, calibrated in R against published MRIP totals, and served through a Shiny
application that fisheries managers use to compose candidate regulation packages per state
and compare their predicted harvest, discards and angler-welfare consequences.

The scientific core is Andrew (Lou) Carr-Harris's Recreation Demand Model: a
discrete-choice model of angler trip-taking behavior, combined with copula-based
simulation of correlated three-species catch per trip and Monte Carlo propagation of
uncertainty across draws. The tool is deployed in Azure and made available to users at
[recreationalfisheriesdst.com](https://recreationalfisheriesdst.com).

This repository is the Mid-Atlantic sibling of **groundfishRDM** (cod and haddock, Gulf of
Maine). The two share a common origin and a near-identical house style — same wrapper
filenames, same toggle convention, same `$developer` startup sequence. They have since
diverged slightly, the team has focused on groundfishRDM in advance of the 2027 management cycle.

## Repository Structure

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `Code/pre_sim/` | Stage 1. Stata data processing (17 `.do` files) plus the R scripts Stata invokes via `rscript using` — the two copula modeling scripts and Google Drive pushes. Orchestrated by `model_wrapper.do`. |
| `Code/sim/` | Stage 2. R calibration and simulation. Orchestrated by `R code wrapper.R`. Also holds `run_state_model.R`, `apply_directed_trips_regs.R` (an incomplete consolidation of the nine per-state scripts) and `required_packages.R`. |
| `Code/helpers/` | Leaf utilities: `developer_setup.R` / `developer_setup_stata.do` (path bootstrap), Google Drive auth, NAA helpers. Not orchestrators. |
| `Code/test_code/` | 21 development and QA scratch scripts (`_test1`, `_test2`, `_revised_v3`, `_nochange` naming). Not called by any wrapper. Archive candidate. |
| `Code/archive/` | 16 superseded predecessors of current `Code/sim/` scripts, including two ~2,300-line copula scripts. Carries its own `README.md`. Relevant because the broken `source()` calls in the projection path point at filenames that now exist only here. |
| `recDST/` | Nine per-state projection runners, `model_run_MA.R` through `model_run_NC.R` (~300 lines each, 70–85% identical). |
| `docs/` | The repository's richest documentation: 22 files — rendered `.Rmd`/`.html` analyses (BSB summary, status-quo comparison, coastwide output, p-star review, user survey) plus regulatory reference material (regulation tables, TC meeting decks, the FY2026 data schedule). |
| `Data/` | Pipeline output consumed downstream. Empty in a fresh checkout. |
| `output/` | Model result CSVs (`output_<ST>_<Run_Name>_<timestamp>.csv`) read by the Shiny app. Empty in a fresh checkout. |
| `saved_regs/` | Submitted regulation scenarios (`regs_<Run_Name>.csv`). Empty in a fresh checkout. |
| `keda/` | KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) configuration — queue-creation scripts, `consume_and_run.sh` worker entrypoint, `scaledjob.yaml`. |
| `shiny-kubernetes-deployment/` | Kubernetes deployment manifests (24 YAML files) with its own `README.md`. |
| `AzurePortal/` | Exported Azure infrastructure configuration (44 files) — VNET, AKS cluster, storage, network watcher. |
| `.secrets/` | Cached `googledrive` OAuth token location. Gitignored; a placeholder is committed. |
| `app.R` | The Shiny application (root level, monolithic ~5,100-line file). |
| `Run_Model.R` | CLI entry point for a projection run: `Rscript Run_Model.R <Run_Name>`. |
| `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, `.Rbuildignore` | R package scaffolding (package name `rdmtool`, version 0.1.0). Vestigial — there is no `R/` directory, so `NAMESPACE`'s `exportPattern` reaches nothing. |
| `Dockerfile` | Shiny app image (`rocker/shiny:4.3`). |
| `Dockerfile.Rmodel` | Model-runner worker image (`rocker/r-ver:4.3.2`). |
| `shiny-server.conf` | Deployment configuration. |
| `documentation.md` | User-facing glossary rendered inside the Shiny app — defines the output statistics managers see. |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `License.txt` | Project boilerplate. |

## Requirements

### R Package Dependencies

Extracted by scanning every `.R` and `.Rmd` file in the repository for `library()`,
`require()`, `pkg::` usage, the `packages` vector that `Code/sim/R code wrapper.R`
attaches via `lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)`, and the
`install.packages()` manifest in `Code/sim/required_packages.R`.

**Version pinning is nearly absent.** There is no `renv.lock` and no explicit version
comments anywhere in the code. `DESCRIPTION` declares only `R (>= 2.10)` and
`Imports: magrittr` — it does not reflect the pipeline's actual dependencies, and
`R (>= 2.10)` is a boilerplate default, not a real constraint (the containers run R 4.3).
Versions below are listed only where the code actually states one.

**Data manipulation and I/O**
`arrow`, `conflicted`, `data.table`, `doBy`, `dplyr`, `feather`, `fs`, `fst`, `glue`,
`haven`, `here`, `magrittr`, `openxlsx`, `plyr`, `purrr`, `readr`, `readxl`, `reshape2`,
`rlang`, `rlist`, `splitstackshape`, `stringr`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`,
`WriteXLS`, `writexl`

**Statistical modeling**
`copula`, `fitdistrplus`, `Hmisc`, `logspline`, `MASS`, `psych`, `Rcpp`, `scales`,
`survey`, `univariateML`, `VineCopula`, `wCorr`, `weights`

**Parallel execution**
`furrr`, `future`, `profvis`

**Plotting and reporting**
`ggplot2`, `knitr`, `lubridate`, `markdown`, `patchwork`, `plotly`, `rgl`

**Shiny**
`DT`, `shiny`, `shinyjs`, `shinyWidgets`

**External data access**
`googledrive`, `httr`, `jsonlite`, `openssl`, `RStata`, `uuid`

Base and recommended packages that ship with R (`parallel`, `stats`, `tools`) are used but
not listed as dependencies.

Compared with groundfishRDM, flukeRDM has **no** assessment-modeling stack (`TMB`, `wham`,
`remotes`) and **no** direct database access (`DBI`, `ROracle`, `mriptacklebox`) — it
receives assessment and MRIP inputs from Google Drive rather than generating or pulling
them itself. Everything else overlaps closely.

**Caveat on `required_packages.R`.** That file's own header states its scope explicitly:
it covers `app.R`, `Run_Model.R` and the `recDST/model_run_*.R` family, but **not** the
calibration and copula scripts in `Code/sim` and `Code/pre_sim`. Installing from it alone
is not sufficient to run the full pipeline. It is not sourced by any wrapper, every call
is unconditional (so re-running reinstalls everything), and it is meant to be run by hand
once when setting up a machine. Prefer the consolidated list above.

### Software Requirements

- **R 4.3** — pinned by the Docker base images: `rocker/shiny:4.3` for the app,
  `rocker/r-ver:4.3.2` for the model-runner worker. `DESCRIPTION`'s `R (>= 2.10)` is not a
  meaningful constraint.
- **Stata 17** — per the technology-stack section of the comprehensive analysis report.
  Stata dependency scanning was out of scope for this documentation pass, so no
  user-written command inventory has been compiled. Expect to install several SSC
  packages.
- **Google Drive access** — `get_assessment_from_gdrive.do` reads from a shared drive and
  assumes the Drive client is mounted at `D:`.
- **Docker / Kubernetes / KEDA / ShinyProxy / Redis Sentinel / Azure** — production
  deployment stack. See `shiny-kubernetes-deployment/` and `AzurePortal/`.

## Running the Pipeline

### Prerequisite: set `developer`, then fix the hard-coded paths

The Stata and R halves require an externally-set developer identifier that **is not
defined anywhere in this repository**: `$developer` in Stata (asserted in
`Code/helpers/developer_setup_stata.do` against `"LCH"`, `"TP"`, `"ML"`, `"KB"`) and
`developer` in R. It branches the data-root path global (`$sfdatadir`).

Separately, `Code/sim/R code wrapper.R` hard-codes two developer-specific absolute paths
in its own top-level assignments (`input_data_cd`, `iterative_input_data_cd`, lines
50–51). Anyone other than the original developer must edit those two lines before the R
wrapper will run. This differs from groundfishRDM, where comparable hard-coded paths are
confined to standalone test scripts.

### The three entry points are not chained

This is the key structural difference from groundfishRDM, where the Stata wrapper's final
step invokes the R wrapper directly. flukeRDM has **three independent entry points with no
code-level connection between any of them**. A person must run all three, in the right
order, by hand:

```
1.  do Code/pre_sim/model_wrapper.do        # Stage 1 — Stata
2.  Rscript "Code/sim/R code wrapper.R"     # Stage 2 — R calibration
3.  Rscript Run_Model.R <Run_Name>          # Stage 3 — projection  [BROKEN, see below]
```

Every hand-off between stages is filesystem-only. Nothing verifies that Stage 1 finished
before Stage 2 starts, or that either ran before Stage 3.

### Stage 1: `Code/pre_sim/model_wrapper.do`

```
 0.                                      developer_setup_stata.do            (unconditional)
 1.  pull_assessment          = 1        get_assessment_from_gdrive.do
 2.  processMRIP              = 1        MRIP_column_cases.do
 3.  assemblemriplists        = 1        MRIP_lists.do
 4.  estimate_dtrips          = 1        directed_trips_calibration.do
       4a.                               └─ set_regulations.do               (nested, unconditional)
 5.  costs_per_trip           = 1        survey_trip_costs.do
 6.  draw_angler_preferences  = 1        estimate_angler_preferences.do
 7.  catch_per_trip1          = 1        catch_per_trip_calibration_part1.do
 8.  copula_in_R              = 1        copula_modeling_calibration.R
 9.  catch_per_trip2          = 1        calibration_catch_per_trip_part2.do
10.  compare_calibration_MRIP = 1        compare_calibration_data_to_MRIP.do
11.  generate_baseline        = 1        calibration_catch_at_length.do
12.  catch_at_length_project  = 1        projected_catch_at_length.do
13.  catch_per_trip_project   = 1        [meta-toggle — all four run or skip together]
       13a.                              ├─ catch_per_trip_projection_part1.do
       13b.                              ├─ copula_modeling_projection.R
       13c.                              ├─ catch_per_trip_projection_part2.do
       13d.                              └─ compare_projection_data_to_MRIP.do
```

**About the toggles.** Sixteen toggle-gated sections, defined as Stata *locals* in one
contiguous block under the `EXECUTION CONTROL` banner at `model_wrapper.do` lines 143–164,
uniformly `0`/`1`. Note two departures from groundfishRDM's one-toggle-per-script pattern:

- `catch_per_trip_project` is a **meta-toggle** gating four scripts as a unit.
- **Three toggles are defined but gate nothing.** `prep_cpt_for_dashboard` (0/OFF,
  self-labeled "NOT WRITTEN"), `Rpush_to_gdrive` (0/OFF, its script exists in
  `Code/pre_sim/` but is never called), and `angler_demogs` (1/ON, no explanatory comment
  at all — groundfishRDM has a fully wired toggle of the same name). Setting any of them
  has no effect.
- `assemblemriplists` gates the **only** definition point for `$catchlist`, `$triplist`,
  `$b2list` and `$sizelist`. Unlike groundfishRDM, the wrapper provides no fallback
  default. It currently defaults ON, so the risk is latent — but turning it off leaves
  several later steps reading undefined globals.

`set_regulations.do` requires **manual editing every year** to enter status-quo
regulations. It is reached only through `estimate_dtrips`.

### The pipeline runs in prototype mode by default

`proto` defaults to **1 (ON)** — the opposite of groundfishRDM. Three observations
compound:

1. `model_wrapper.do` sets `global ndraws 100`.
2. `local proto = 1` then overwrites it: `global ndraws 3`.
3. Both copula scripts hard-code `n_draws <- 3` and never read `$ndraws`.

Downstream Stata scripts loop `forv i=1/$ndraws` over draw files that only the copula step
writes. **So setting `proto = 0` for a production run makes the pipeline look for 100 draw
files where only 3 exist, and fail at draw 4.** A full-size run requires editing `n_draws`
in *both* copula scripts as well as clearing `proto`. Nothing in the code or comments says
so.

Iteration counts disagree in six places and none are programmatically linked:

| Setting | Location | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `$ndraws` | `model_wrapper.do` | 100, overwritten to 3 by `proto` |
| `n_draws` | both copula scripts | 3 (hard-coded) |
| `n_simulations` | `Code/sim/R code wrapper.R` | 10 |
| `n_simulations` | `Code/sim/predict_rec_catch_final.R` | 3 (re-declared, overrides the above) |
| `n_simulations` | `Code/test_code/run_projection_final.R` | 125 |
| draw range | every `recDST/model_run_<ST>.R` | `1:100` (hard-coded, ignores all of the above) |

### Stage 2: `Code/sim/R code wrapper.R`

```
Code/sim/R code wrapper.R
  ├─ calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R   ["STEP 1"]
  ├─ calibration_routine_final.R        ["STEP 2"]
  │    └─ calibrate_rec_catch1_final.R  (re-sourced inside internal loops)
  └─ predict_rec_catch_final.R          ["STEP 3"]
```

All three unconditional. Must be launched separately — `model_wrapper.do` never
references it.

### Stage 3: `Run_Model.R` — known broken as committed

```
Rscript Run_Model.R <Run_Name>
```

`Run_Model.R` reads `saved_regs/regs_<Run_Name>.csv` and sources
`recDST/model_run_<ST>.R` for each state present in it, skipping states the scenario does
not touch (so a Massachusetts-only run costs one state's runtime, not nine).

**This path does not run as committed.** Each per-state script's per-draw worker
(`get_predictions_out()`, around lines 357–358) sources two files that do not exist at the
given paths:

```r
source(here::here("Code/sim/predict_rec_catch_functions.R"))   # only exists in Code/archive/
source(here::here("Code/sim/predict_rec_catch.R"))             # exists nowhere; closest is
                                                               # Code/sim/predict_rec_catch_final.R
```
The developer team is in the process of fixing these issues.

A run fails on the first draw of the first state attempted. This is consistent with a
rename inside `Code/sim/` that did not update its callers, and the contents of
`Code/archive/` support that reading. **The developers are aware; a fix may exist on an
unpushed branch.**

`Code/sim/run_state_model.R` carries the same two broken `source()` calls plus a third
defect of its own — it calls `apply_directed_trips_regs()`, which is never sourced
anywhere in the repository. It is **not** on this code path, however: the
`model_run_<ST>.R` scripts define their own worker rather than calling
`run_state_model()`. Treat `run_state_model.R` and `apply_directed_trips_regs.R` as an
incomplete consolidation of the nine per-state scripts, not as live code.

Scripts with no confirmed caller anywhere in the repo:
`Code/sim/check calibration convergence.do`, `Code/sim/compare_savedregs_output.R` (which
additionally contains a syntax error and cannot be parsed), `Code/sim/generate_coastwide_data.R`,
`Code/helpers/googledrivesetup.R`, `Code/sim/required_packages.R`,
`Code/pre_sim/rdb_catch_per_trip_to_drive.R`.

```

**Every hand-off is filesystem-only** — there is no code-level chain anywhere in this
pipeline, in contrast to groundfishRDM's Stata → R chain.

Cross-script state is carried by Stata **global macros** set in the wrapper and read by
every script running later in the same session — paths (`$misc_data_cd`, `$figure_cd`,
`$sfdatadir`, `$calib_catch_data_cd`), settings (`$ndraws`, `$seed 03211990`). A script
expecting a global the wrapper did not set will silently do the wrong thing rather than
error. The R side follows the same pattern with global-environment objects set at the top
of `R code wrapper.R` (`code_cd`, `input_data_cd`, `iterative_input_data_cd`,
`n_simulations`, `n_draws`).

**The input-ID contract.** The one convention that ties `app.R` to the model scripts is
input naming: Shiny input IDs follow `<SPECIES><state><MODE>_<field>`, e.g.
`SFmaFH_seas1_op`. Those exact strings are written into `saved_regs/regs_<Run_Name>.csv`
as the `input` column, and each per-state model script recreates them as variables via
`assign()`. Nothing validates that the names a scenario supplies are the names the model
expects — **renaming an input ID in `app.R` silently breaks the corresponding
`model_run_<ST>.R`** rather than raising an error.

## Running the Shiny Application

```r
# from the repository root
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

`app.R` is a single ~5,100-line file — no `global.R`/`ui.R`/`server.R` split, no
`source()` or `system()` calls. Navigate it by the section banners in its header:
Section A is the UI, Section D (~3,200 lines, roughly two thirds of the file) is nine
near-identical per-state regulation-input blocks, and Sections E–I cover summary tables,
figures, scenario submission and result downloads. Reading one state's block in Section D
is sufficient to understand all nine.

**Must exist before launching:**

| Requirement | Produced by |
|---|---|
| `output/*.csv` | Stage 3 projection runs, which in turn need Stages 1 and 2 to have completed |
| `saved_regs/*.csv` | Previous submissions through the app; the directory must exist for new scenarios to be written |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE_URL` | Environment variable holding a SAS-authenticated Azure Storage queue URL. Without it, submitting a run fails. |

Both directories exist in the repository but are empty. With them empty the app launches
but the results tab has nothing to display.

**The app never runs the simulation.** Submitting a scenario writes
`saved_regs/regs_<Run_Name>.csv` and posts one queue message; a separate worker
(`keda/consume_and_run.sh`, running the `Dockerfile.Rmodel` image) consumes it and runs
`Rscript Run_Model.R <Run_Name>`. Because Stage 3 is currently broken (see above), that
worker cannot presently complete a run from a clean checkout.

`documentation.md` — rendered inside the app — is the user-facing glossary of the output
statistics managers see (compensating variation, harvest/release numbers and pounds, dead
release numbers, percent difference from status quo, percent under harvest target).

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

**Blocking**
- The Stage 3 projection path does not run as committed — two missing `source()` targets
  in every per-state script. See [Running the Pipeline](#running-the-pipeline).
- `Code/sim/compare_savedregs_output.R` contains a syntax error and cannot be parsed.
- The committed default is prototype mode, and switching to production requires edits in
  three places.

**Pipeline structure**
- Three entry points, zero code-level links between them. Stage ordering exists only in a
  maintainer's head.
- Three toggles are defined but gate nothing; one (`angler_demogs`) has no explanatory
  comment at all.
- `assemblemriplists` is the only definition point for four widely-read globals, with no
  fallback default.
- `$developer` is required 

**Portability**
- Hard-coded developer-specific absolute paths reach into production files here, not just
  test scripts: `R code wrapper.R`, `calibrate_rec_catch0_optimized.R`,
  `calibration_routine_final.R`, `predict_rec_catch_final.R` (which re-hard-codes a path,
  overriding its caller), both copula scripts, and most of `Code/test_code/`. One
  developer's folder is spelled inconsistently between files (`E:/Lou_projects` and
  `E:/Lou's projects`).
- `get_assessment_from_gdrive.do` assumes the Google Drive client mounts at `D:`.
- No dependency management — no `renv.lock`, no package versions specified.
- `plyr` is attached before `dplyr` deliberately (it masks `summarize`, `count`, `mutate`,
  `rename`); the `conflicts_prefer()` calls make the resolution explicit. Do not reorder.
- Magic numbers embedded without explanation, notably `254` — the "no minimum size"
  sentinel (100 inches × 2.54 cm).

**Interpreting all of this.** flukeRDM has had less development time than
groundfishRDM, which has already received a hardening pass that flukeRDM is slated to
receive next. Most gaps above — the broken projection path, the prototype-mode default,
the missing global fallback, the undocumented dead toggle — look like exactly what that
pass would close.

## Glossary

The terms below are the ones you will hit immediately. The full glossary — covering Stata
idioms (`preserve`/`restore`, `capture`, `postfile`, the accumulate idiom, variable
abbreviation), R idioms (`data.table` `:=` and NSE, `setDTthreads(1)`,
`conflicts_prefer()`, `assign()` into an environment, Shiny reactives) and the rest of the
modeling vocabulary — is in `GLOSSARY_FLUKE.md`. For the *output statistics* the app
displays, see `documentation.md` in this repository.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Wrapper script** | A script whose job is running other scripts in order, with sections switched on or off by flags, rather than processing data itself. |
| **Toggle** | A `0`/`1` local macro in `model_wrapper.do` gating whether a block runs on this pass. Setting one to `0` deletes nothing — it skips a step whose output is already on disk. |
| **Meta-toggle** | A toggle gating several scripts as one unit rather than individually. `catch_per_trip_project` is the one instance here. |
| **Dead toggle** | A toggle defined in the wrapper with no matching `if` block — setting it has no effect. Three exist here. |
| **Prototype mode** | The `proto` local. When on (**the committed default**), it overwrites `$ndraws` from 100 to 3 for fast runs. |
| **Entry point** | A script a person starts directly, as opposed to one that something else calls. This repository has three, and none of them calls another. |
| **Global macro** | A Stata value defined with `global`, readable as `$name` in *any* script running later in the same session. Because they persist, a script expecting a global the wrapper never set will silently misbehave. |
| **`svyset` / `svy:`** | Declares the survey sampling design, then runs an estimator that respects it. MRIP is a complex survey — a plain `mean` gives the wrong standard error. |
| **MRIP** | Marine Recreational Information Program — the survey producing the catch and effort estimates this model calibrates to. |
| **Draw** | One complete realization of the simulation, carrying one sampled value of every uncertain input. Results are summarized as medians and intervals across draws. |
| **Stratum** | The grouping the model works in: state × wave × mode, sometimes further by kind-of-day. |
| **Wave** | A two-month MRIP sampling period; wave 1 is January–February, through wave 6. |
| **Mode** | How the trip was taken: `pr` private boat, `fh` for-hire (charter and headboat), `sh` shore. |
| **Kind-of-day** | Weekend versus weekday, used for effort estimation. |
| **Directed trip** | A trip that targeted or caught one of the three managed species. The unit effort is measured in. |
| **Calibration vs. projection year** | The calibration year is the recent year the model is tuned to reproduce; the projection year is the future year whose regulations are being evaluated. Many scripts come in matched pairs, one per period. |
| **Status quo (SQ)** | The run using current regulations, against which every alternative scenario is compared. |
| **Copula** | A way of simulating several correlated quantities (catch of the three species on one trip) while letting each keep its own marginal distribution. |
| **Reallocation / the proportion `p`** | The calibration's adjustment moving fish between kept and released until simulated totals match MRIP. |
| **Accounting vs. utility columns** | During reallocation a fish moved from kept to released changes the accounting columns and the utility columns differently — the distinction matters when reading the calibration code. |
| **Fish-level expansion** | Expanding a trip's catch count into one row per fish, so length-based regulations can be applied individually. |
| **Hurdle (two-part) model** | Modeling "did this happen at all" separately from "how much, given it happened". |
| **Catch-at-length** | The length composition of the fish anglers encounter. |
| **Age-length key** | A table converting numbers-at-age (what the assessment produces) into numbers-at-length. |
| **The 254 sentinel** | A minimum size of 254 (100 inches × 2.54 cm) meaning "no minimum size applies". |
| **Compensating variation (CV)** | The dollar amount making an angler as well off under the new policy as under the baseline. The app displays `CV_SQ − CV_alt`; see `documentation.md` for the exact definition managers see. |
